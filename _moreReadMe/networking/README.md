# Networking

Java Networking is a concept of connecting two or more computing devices together so that we can share resources.

Java Socket Programming provides facility to share data between different computing devices.

**Advantage of Java Networking :**
-	sharing resources
-	centralized software management

## Java Networking Terminology :

Some of the widely used java networking terminologies are as follows:

1.	IP Address
    - IP address is a unique number assigned to a node of a network e.g. 192.168.0.1. It is composed of octets that range from 0 to 255.
It is a logical address that can be changed.

2.	Protocol
    - A protocol is a set of rules basically that is followed for communication. For example: TCP, FTP, Telnet, SMTP, POP, etc.

3.	Port Number
    - The port number is used to uniquely identify different applications. It acts as a communication endpoint between applications. The port number is associated with the IP address for communication between two applications.

4.	MAC Address
    - MAC (Media Access Control) Address is a unique identifier of NIC (Network Interface Controller). A network node can have multiple NIC but each with unique MAC. The main difference between MAC and IP address is that, MAC Address is used to ensure the physical address of computer. It uniquely identifies the devices on a network. While IP address are used to uniquely identifies the connection of network with that device take part in a network.

5.	Socket
    - A socket is an endpoint between two way communication. More details in "Socket" section below.

6.	Connection-oriented protocol
    - In connection-oriented protocol, acknowledgement is sent by the receiver. So, it is reliable but slow. The example of connection-oriented protocol is TCP.

7.  Connection-less protocol
    - In connection-less protocol, acknowledgement is not sent by the receiver. So, it is not reliable but fast. The example of connection-less protocol is UDP.

## java.net package
The java.net package provides many classes to deal with networking applications in Java. A list of these classes is given below:

- Authenticator
- CacheRequest
- CacheResponse
- ContentHandler
- CookieHandler
- CookieManager
- DatagramPacket
- DatagramSocket
- DatagramSocketImpl
- InterfaceAddress
- JarURLConnection
- MulticastSocket
- InetSocketAddress
- InetAddress
- Inet4Address
- Inet6Address
- IDN
- HttpURLConnection
- HttpCookie
- NetPermission
- NetworkInterface
- PasswordAuthentication
- Proxy
- ProxySelector
- ResponseCache
- SecureCacheResponse
- ServerSocket
- Socket
- SocketAddress
- SocketImpl
- SocketPermission
- StandardSocketOptions
- URI
- URL
- URLClassLoader
- URLConnection
- URLDecoder
- URLEncoder
- URLStreamHandler

## Java Socket Programming

Java Socket programming is used for communication between the applications running on different JRE. Java Socket programming can be connection-oriented or connection-less.

Socket and ServerSocket classes are used for connection-oriented socket programming and DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket classes are used for connection-less socket programming.

**Constructor :**
```
public ObjectOutputStream(OutputStream out) throws IOException {}
```
Above constructor creates an ObjectOutputStream that writes to the specified OutputStream.

**Important Methods :**
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1) public final void writeObject(Object obj) throws IOException {}</td><td>writes the specified object to the ObjectOutputStream. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2) public void flush() throws IOException {}</td><td>flushes the current output stream. </td></tr>
<tr><td>3) public void close() throws IOException {}</td><td>closes the current output stream. </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Example of Java Serialization
Example to serialize the object of Student class.
```
import java.io.*;  
class Persist{  
 public static void main(String args[])throws Exception{  
  Student s1 =new Student(211,"John");  
  
  FileOutputStream fout=new FileOutputStream("f.txt");  
  ObjectOutputStream out=new ObjectOutputStream(fout);  
  
  out.writeObject(s1);  
  out.flush();  
  System.out.println("success");  
 }  
}  
```

## Deserialization in java
Deserialization is the process of reconstructing the object from the serialized state.It is the reverse operation of serialization.

## ObjectInputStream class
An ObjectInputStream deserializes objects and primitive data written using an ObjectOutputStream.

**Constructor :**
```
public ObjectInputStream(InputStream in) throws IOException {}
```
Above constructor creates an ObjectInputStream that reads from the specified InputStream.

**Important Methods :**
<table class="alt">
<tbody><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1) public final Object readObject() throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException{}</td><td>reads an object from the input stream. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2) public void close() throws IOException {}</td><td>closes ObjectInputStream.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Example of Java Deserialization
Example to deserialize the object of Student class.
```
import java.io.*;  
class Depersist{  
 public static void main(String args[])throws Exception{  
    
  ObjectInputStream in=new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("f.txt"));  
  Student s=(Student)in.readObject();  
  System.out.println(s.id+" "+s.name);  
  
  in.close();  
 }  
}  
```

## Serialization Rules

**Serialization with Inheritance (IS-A Relationship) :**
If a class implements serializable then all its sub classes will also be serializable. Parent class properties are inherited to subclasses so if parent class is Serializable, subclass would also be.

**Serialization with Aggregation (HAS-A Relationship) :**
If a class has a reference of another class, all the references must be Serializable otherwise serialization process will not be performed. In such case, NotSerializableException is thrown at runtime. 

All the objects within an object must be Serializable.

**Serialization with static data member :**
If there is any static data member in a class, it will not be serialized because static is the part of class not object.

**Serialization with array or collection :**
In case of array or collection, all the objects of array or collection must be serializable. If any object is not serialiizable, serialization will be failed.

## Externalizable in Java
The Externalizable interface provides the facility of writing the state of an object into a byte stream in compress format. It is not a marker interface.

The Externalizable interface provides two methods:
- public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException
- public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException

## Java Transient Keyword
If you don't want to serialize any data member of a class, you can mark it as transient.
**Example :**
```
transient int age; //It will not be serialized  
```
