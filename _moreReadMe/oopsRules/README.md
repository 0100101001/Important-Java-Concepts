# Few Things to Remember

## Definitions, Tips & Rules related to Java OOPS

### Class & Constructor
- A class in Java can contain: fields, methods, constructors, blocks, nested class and interface.
- Object is an instance of a class.
- Constructor in java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object.
- If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.
- There is no copy constructor in java. But, we can copy the values of one object to another like copy constructor in C++.
- A constructor can perform other tasks instead of initialization like object creation, starting a thread, calling method etc. You can perform any operation in the constructor as you perform in the method.

### static Keyword
- The static can be: variable (class variable), method (class method), block & nested class.
- Java static property is shared to all objects.
- A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
- A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
- A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.
- The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
- this and super cannot be used in static context.
- The main method is static because object is not required to call static method if it were non-static method, jvm create object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.
- A static block is used to initialize the static data member. It is executed before main method at the time of classloading.

### this Keyword
- In Java, this is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
- Call to this() must be the first statement in constructor.
- this can be used to: refer current class instance variable, invoke current class method and constructor. 
- this canpassed as an argument in the method and constructor call.
- this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.
- It is better approach to use meaningful names for variables. So we use same name for instance variables and parameters in real time, and always use this keyword.

### Inheritance
- Inheritance (IS-A) is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent object.
- The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class.
- Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class. We can use Interface to perform it.
- To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
- If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation (HAS-A relationship).
- Inheritance should be used only if the relationship is-a is maintained throughout the lifetime of the objects involved; otherwise, aggregation is the best choice.

### Method Overloading
- If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.
- There are two ways to overload the method in java : by changing number of arguments, by changing the data type.
- In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only because of ambiguity.
- Compile Time Error is better than Run Time Error. So, java compiler renders compiler time error if you declare the same method having same parameters.
- We can also overload Java main() method, but JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only.
- One type is promoted to another implicitly if no matching datatype is found. eg. byte can be promoted to short, int, etc.
- If there are no matching type arguments method, and each method promotes similar number of arguments, there will be ambiguity.
- One type is not de-promoted implicitly for example double cannot be depromoted to any type implicitly.

## Method Overriding
- If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding.
- - Method must have same name and parameters as in the parent class for overriding.
- Method overriding is used to provide specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its super class. Also used for runtime polymorphism.
- We cannot override static method (not also main method) because static method is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with object. Static belongs to class area and instance belongs to heap area.
- Method Overriding with Access Modifier: if you are overriding a method, overridden method (i.e. declared in subclass) must not be more restrictive.
-  Covariant Return Type: It is possible to override method by changing the return type if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive but it changes its return type to subclass type. 

## super Keyword
- The super keyword in java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.
