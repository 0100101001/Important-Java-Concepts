# Java Fundamentals and Object Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance. Main Concepts - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation.

## Constructors vs Methods

## Types of Inheritance (Supported through Class)

## Types of Inheritance (Supported through Interface only)

To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple (hybrid is also multiple) inheritance is not supported in java through classes. Consider a scenario where A, B and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have same method and you call it from child class object, there will be ambiguity to call method of A or B class. Since compile time errors are better than runtime errors, java renders compile time error if you inherit 2 classes. So whether you have same method or different, there will be compile time error.

## Polymorphism - Method Overloading vs Method Overriding
